 I developed a to-do app that allows users to organize tasks into different categories, with each category containing its own list of subtasks. You can perform various operations on both categories and subtasks, such as adding and updating tasks, including descriptions for subtasks, and deleting tasks or categories once they are completed. Additionally, tasks can be marked as completed when finished. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface to ensure that anyone can navigate the app easily.

Since this was my first experience working with React Native and SQLite, I encountered a few challenges along the way. I frequently referred to documentation and other resources to overcome obstacles, especially when dealing with new errors. Platforms like Stack Overflow were invaluable for understanding and resolving these issues. Overall, working on this project has been a great learning experience for me.
